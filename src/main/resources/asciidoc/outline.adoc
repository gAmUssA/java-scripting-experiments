Questions:

* Should we require Java 8 installed on the attendees laptops? Will we host Java back-end on the instructor's machine? Will we use apiary.io instead of self-written Java back-end?

== icon:book[] Summary

In this course we assume the attendees know nothing about AngularJS, so we will cover it from very basics to the advanced scenarios. We will also briefly revisit the most confusing JavaScript topics like closures, constructor functions and prototypal inheritance. During the course we will develop a single-page web application starting from "Hello World" and finishing with production-ready real-world application. We'll leave no magic behind AngularJS two-way data binding and learn how AngularJS works under the hood. We'll also master the tools that boost productivity in JavaScript environment. So, hopefully next time you need to develop a web app, you'll pick AngularJS and deliver incomparably better product than you can do with plain JavaScript and jQuery.


== icon:check[] Prerequisites

|45 min

|6
|*icon:laptop[role="red"] Hands-on: Mastering Tools* +
The attendees receive new version of Online Auction app based on the generated Yeoman template. They need to add 3rd-party libraries and configure additional Grunt tasks and targets to enable http://lesscss.org[LESS] support for the project. +

|40 min

|9
|*AngularJS Directives* +
Decomposing UI with AngularJS directives, creating reusable components, isolated scope, wrapping 3rd-party UI components (e.g. jQueryUI calendar) to enable two-way data binding.
