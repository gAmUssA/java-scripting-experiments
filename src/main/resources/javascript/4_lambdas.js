/*
Many constructs are familiar to JavaScript developers.  The main things to note;
where you can use a Lambda you can use a JavaScript function
JavaScript arrays need to be converted to Java collections
JavaScript syntax requires the '.' end a phrase, not start one (forces continuation)
Other than that, the JavaScript source and Java source looks very much the same.
